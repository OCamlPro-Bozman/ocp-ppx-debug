# ocp-ppx-debug

Small PPX to add prints at beginning and end of functions and match
cases.

This ppx is at a really early development state. The idea is to be
able to follow a really simple state of the execution by adding prints
at the beginning and end of each function and match case. It might be
improved later to be much more useful (adding a companion library that
helps controlling the information printed, adding some form of
indentation, etc).
